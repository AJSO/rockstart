{"name":"RockStart","tagline":"A multi-tenant website template based on CodeIgniter 3 with integration of some useful tools.","body":"### Ci3 Starter Project\r\n\r\nThis project is based on the [CI_bootstrap_3](https://github.com/waifung0207/ci_bootstrap_3) and my vison for an efficient system and simple.\r\n\r\nUsing CodeIgniter 3\r\n- Front-end \r\n   - Bootstrap 3 (and themes)\r\n   - Google Fonts\r\n- Back-end\r\n   - AmdinLE\r\n- Auth system (ability for front-end users and back-end users)\r\n- Multilang (maybe read the translation CI3 files and display them editable on the backend)\r\n- less compiler\r\n- minify css ans js (maybe...)\r\n\r\n- utilities to build on the backend\r\n  - Grocery CRUD (v1.5.1) - feature-rich library to build CRUD tables\r\n  - Image CRUD (v0.6) - CRUD library for image management - Creating a media library\r\n  - File navigator and editor\r\n  - Wysiwyg text areas, based on AdminLE proposed solution (CFKEditor)\r\n  - Databse table editor\r\n  - user management - create/edite/delete Users and Roles\r\n\r\n  - Form builder, maybe look at the ideas on [Bolt](https://docs.bolt.cm/contenttypes-and-records) files for content types and forms.\r\n  - less variables graphical editor... scan less files, find variables, and put them on the backoffice in a list with a color picker and space to fill css properties.[link](http://pikock.github.io/bootstrap-magic/app/index.html#!/editor)\r\n\r\nImportant side goals:\r\n - Deployment is copy/paste\r\n - Urls are relative, avoid the Wordpress mess on moving sites around\r\n - Database is sqllite (using htaccess to protect web access to DB), \r\n     - can be Mysql, but the copy/paste deplyment gets a bit more complicated\r\n - Possibility to have development environment and production environment on the same place (staging)\r\n - Smart embedd - Like paste url on facebook or wordpress and automatic embedd of video or page thumbnails... think better about this. \r\n - Simple setup configuration - Have a single file to configure the app, not a single folder with many files like CodeIgniter has.\r\n\r\n - Desirable - Could be important to have newsletter capabilities... \r\n   - mode simple:\r\n       - Works from the system\r\n       - have a hand-mantained template. \r\n       - send mails from CI3 directly, \r\n       - manage mailing list\r\n       - subscribe \"shortcode\" (like wordpress shortcodes)\r\n       - seems a lot of work and difficult to have quality solution\r\n   - mode integrated:\r\n       - setup api key and integrate with some mailing system (mailchimp, mailgun, ...)\r\n       - use the foreign system api to provide an embedded solution, ie., managing the lists, and creation and sending of emails is done on backoffice and we use API to call 3rf party services.\r\n       - seems a lot of work, makes the system dependent on 3rd party\r\n   - mode outOfTheWay:\r\n       - provide a skeleton subscribe form for capturing email addresses and store them. \r\n       - provide an export list to a format easy to import on those 3rd party systems (csv) and use them separate from our app.\r\n       - ** probably try this**\r\n\r\nCurrent differences with original:\r\n   - I want simple, so no GLUP, no commandline tools required (but it should be possible to call composer one day)\r\n   - no migrations. At the moment, migrations seem like an overhead, we only want to go forward not go back.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
